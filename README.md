# Number Guessing Game (A Simple Python CLI Program)

 ## 🎯  Overview of the Project
 This is a straightforward Python number guessing game that runs on the console.  The objective is to illustrate basic programming ideas like function calls, conditional logic, and loops.


 ## ⚙️ Implementation Specifics: **Applicable Concept:** Overview of Python Programming & Problem Solving.
 Key characteristics:
     1. Produces a random integer between 1 and 50.
     2. Enables the user to enter guesses repeatedly until they are accurate.
     3. Offers prompt feedback ("Too low," "Too high").
     4. Offers simple error correction for input that isn't numeric.
 **Primary Ideas Exhibited: **
     - `import random` (use of modules)
     - iterative logic's `while True` loop
     - `if/elif/else` statements (game logic/decision making)
     - `try...except` block (handling errors)

        ## 🏃 How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone [here paste your repository url ]`
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the script: `python NumberGuessingGame.py`
