# Number Guessing Game (A Basic Python CLI Application)

## 🎯 Project Overview
This is a simple console-based number guessing game developed in Python. The goal is to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditional logic, and function calls.

## ⚙️ Implementation Details
- **Concept Applied:** Introduction to Problem Solving & Programming (Python).
- **Core Features:**
    1. Generates a random integer within a defined range (1 to 50).
    2. Allows the user to input guesses repeatedly until correct.
    3. Provides immediate feedback ("Too high," "Too low").
    4. Includes basic error handling for non-numeric input.
- **Key Concepts Demonstrated:**
    - `import random` (Module usage)
    - `while True` loop (Iterative logic)
    - `if/elif/else` statements (Decision making/Game logic)
    - `try...except` block (Error handling)

## 🏃 How to Run
